Title: OOP Programming Assessment - Card Shuffler and Dealer

This is a program that shuffles cards in 3 ways:
-Riffle Shuffle
-Fisher-Yates Shuffle
-No Shuffle

These shuffles are run from the Testing.cs class and are done autoatically
currently however this can be easily altered to fit into whatever project
is required.

To use the program as of now to see the code in action you simply run the
program and it will display on teh screen if the shuffles have correctly run
and it will deal a single card. After this it will ask for an amount of cards
to deal and this is the only input that you are required to give.

Any suggestions please feel free to leave them on my GitHub!
